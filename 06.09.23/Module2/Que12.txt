In Java, the final keyword is used to indicate that a particular element (class, method, variable, or field) is unchangeable, constant, or cannot be overridden, depending on where it is applied. 

Final Variables (Constants):
When you declare a variable as final, it becomes a constant, and its value cannot be changed once it's assigned. This is often used for values that should not be modified.
final int MAX_VALUE = 100;

Final Methods:
When you declare a method as final in a class, it cannot be overridden by subclasses. This is useful when you want to prevent further modification of a method's behavior in derived classes, ensuring method consistency.
class Parent {
    final void display() {
        // ...
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // This will result in a compilation error
    void display() {
        // ...
    }
}
